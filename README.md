# Sound Cloud Clone

This is a music player mobile app made with Flutter, using Firebase for backend and 3rd party API for getting music data and playing it.
The UI is inspired by SoundCloud.
Watch a 2-minute demo [here](https://youtu.be/_hn9U-Pwi5M).

## This project uses
- Flutter's widget library & MaterialApp for UI.
- BLoC for state management.
- Firebase for authentication and data storage.
- Dio for handling API calls.
